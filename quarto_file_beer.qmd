  Excessive Guinness consumption among nephrologists in the UK has led to increased rates of iron overload and iatrogenic haemochromatosis. This cross-sectional study aimed to quantify iron levels and prevalence of iron overload in this population. Serum ferritin was measured in 375 nephrologists. MRI scans quantified liver iron content. Iron overload (ferritin >300 μg/L in men and >200 μg/L in women) was found in 19% of nephrologists. Liver iron concentration consistent with iron overload was present in 9%. Guinness consumption was positively associated with serum ferritin levels. Public health interventions are urgently needed to reduce Guinness-related iron overload in this population.

<b>Abstract</b>

<p>Excessive Guinness consumption among nephrologists in the UK has led to increased rates of iron overload and iatrogenic haemochromatosis. This cross-sectional study aimed to quantify iron levels and prevalence of iron overload in this population. Serum ferritin was measured in 375 nephrologists. MRI scans quantified liver iron content. Iron overload (ferritin >300 μg/L in men and >200 μg/L in women) was found in 19% of nephrologists. Liver iron concentration consistent with iron overload was present in 9%. Guinness consumption was positively associated with serum ferritin levels. Public health interventions are urgently needed to reduce Guinness-related iron overload in this population.</p>

<p>Excessive alcohol consumption, especially of dark beers high in iron such as Guinness, has been associated with increased risk of iron overload and iatrogenic haemochromatosis [1]. This can occur due to both the high iron content of the beer itself, as well as alcohol's effects on increasing absorption of dietary iron [2].</p> 

<p>Nephrologists in the UK have long had a reputation for enjoying a pint or two after work [3,4]. With the rising popularity of Irish pubs, many nephrologists have developed a particular penchant for Guinness. However, the consequences of excessive Guinness consumption have not been well studied.</p>

<p>In this cross-sectional study, we measured serum ferritin and performed MRI assessment of liver iron content in 375 nephrologists from across the UK. Participants also completed a survey on their beer drinking habits.</p>

<p>Results showed 19% of nephrologists had serum ferritin levels consistent with iron overload (>300 μg/L in men and >200 μg/L in women) [5]. MRI detected increased liver iron concentrations in 9% of participants.</p> 

<p>Self-reported Guinness consumption was positively associated with serum ferritin levels, with higher intake linked to greater risk of iron overload (Figure 1).</p>

<p>In conclusion, excessive Guinness consumption is causing an epidemic of iron overload in the UK nephrology community. Public health efforts are urgently needed to increase awareness and reduce Guinness-related harm.</p>
